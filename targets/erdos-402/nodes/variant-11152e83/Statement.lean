/-! Graham's gcd conjecture (Erdős problem 402) for twelve-element sets. With M the largest
element, if gcd(M, x) > M/12 for every x then every other x is (j/k)M with j < k ≤ 11, so
L·x/M (L = lcm(1..11) = 27720) lies in a fixed set S of 41 values. S splits into 10 classes in
each of which any two distinct values c, d have 12·gcd(c, d) ≤ c or ≤ d; by pigeonhole two of
the 11 other elements share a class, and gcd(x, y)·L = gcd(c, d)·M transfers the bound. -/

theorem Opn.erdos_402_card_twelve :
    ∀ (A : Finset ℕ), 0 ∉ A → A.card = 12 → ∃ a ∈ A, ∃ b ∈ A, a.gcd b ≤ (a / A.card : ℚ) := by
