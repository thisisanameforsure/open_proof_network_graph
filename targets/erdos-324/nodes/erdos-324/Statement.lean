Erdős problem 324: Does there exist a polynomial $f(x)\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ such that all the sums $f(a)+f(b)$ with $a < b$ nonnegative integers are distinct? — imported from google-deepmind/formal-conjectures (FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/324.lean at c7f31d5fd3d2ca3d69979f2d213eb9b58fe956ae, Apache-2.0); the registry states a yes/no question as `answer(sorry) ↔ P`; this states P, its affirmative reading (F11-Q24).
